# Data Design and OOP Relflection

### In a syntactically correct response, answer the following questions.
***

1. What is the most significant thing you have learned about object oriented?

    `The notion of determing the purpose of a state/data (what is it for?) and implementing its behaviors/methods (what does it do?).`

2. What is the most significant thing you have learned about the effect of the frontend on the backend?

    `The most significant thing would be the interplay of end-user interaction with the UI that really helps to determine and specify the design of backend. For example if a user needs access to all their records on a medical reporting system using a CLI to display, update, and download every bit of data the hospital recorded, then have them search for their name would be overly complex and difficult to use in most cases. Rather having a records system that displayed a file manager with their most recent lab reports and hospital visits would indicate a backend that only needed to associate lab reports and visit summaries with a user account.`  

3. Why is encapsulation so important?

    `Encapsulation is so important because it binds data to the methods acting on that data. It also important because it provides a hierarchical scope that limits the visibility of values or state of a data object within a class like a Russian nesting doll hides it's inner most doll.` 


4. What is the air speed velocity of an unladen swallow?  
    
    `What do you mean? African or Eurpean swallow?`
